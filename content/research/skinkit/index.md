### Overview

> We introduce SkinKit, a new construction toolkit for on-skin interface prototyping.
> The modules are made of slim, skin-conformable tessellated base substrates, with Flexible PCB blocks which would be worn on diverse body locations.
> The SkinKit system provides three module connection methods that provide flexibility to be worn on different body locations.
